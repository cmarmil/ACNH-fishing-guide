A directory of Animal Crossing New Horizons fish including information about fish sell price, location, availability, and catch difficulty. 
Written in vanilla javascript, css, and HTML. Not compatible with older browsers that do not support es6, as I wanted to keep this a simple exercise in developing UI without libraries or polyfills.
